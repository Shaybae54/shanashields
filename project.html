      <p>There are many software programs and apps that are geared toward home baking businesses and allow users to calculate and schedule their upcoming orders and keep track of inventory, but none allow the storing of important files along with
        running a small business nor keeps track of business tasks on the go via mobile.</p>

      <p>Sprinkle focuses on managing the daily business tasks for the home baking entrepreneur. Users can create and keep track of orders and inventory, as well as keeping notes about client preferences and allergies. Unlike other services for home
        bakers, users can even upload and store documents to have access on the go.</p>

    <!--User Personas-->
    <section id="personas" class="sections">
      <img src="Images/case/personastab.svg" alt="user personas" class="tab" />
      <p> I made 2 user personas that represented real-world users with varying degrees of frustrations and desires from data I collected from the user surveys and competitive analysis.</p>

    <!--User Stories-->
    <section id="stories" class="sections">
      <img src="Images/case/storiestab.svg" alt="user stories" class="tab" />
      <p>Next I created user stories to start the process of visualizing what the users want to accomplish. These were from two different perspectives: New user and returning user and ranked in degrees of importance (high, medium and low.)</p>
      <img src="Images/case/userstories.svg" alt="user stories" class="user_stories" />

    <!--User Flows-->

      <img src="Images/case/flowstab.svg" alt="user flows" class="tab" />
      <img src="Images/case/userflow.svg" alt="user flow" class="user_flow" />
      <p class="flows1">From my user stories I was able to create user flows for each high priority task to demonstrate how users will navigate to complete various actions. First i sketched them out via pen and paper, then created flows digitally.
      These flows are critical to identifying key functions within the app and which screens to focus on first. Completing this set the foundations of the app design.</p>
      <div class="sitemaps">
        <div class="sitetext">
          <p>I used my research data, user stories, and user flows to create a sitemap in order to organize each destination in the user flows. The sitemap was used as an outline to create the content strategy and help me further focus on keeping the
            project within scope and further helped solidify the foundation of the project.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sitepic">
          <img src="Images/case/sitemap.svg" alt="sitemap" class="sitemap" />

    <!--Wireframing-->
    <section id="wire" class="sections">
      <img src="Images/case/wiretab.svg" alt="wireframing" class="tab" />
      <div class="sketches">
        <img src="Images/case/recipepage1.jpg" alt="wireframe sketch" class="sketch" />
        <img src="Images/case/addrecipe.jpg" alt="wireframe sketch" class="sketch" />
        <img src="Images/case/recipepage2.jpg" alt="wireframe sketch" class="sketch" />
      </div>
      <p>Now that I have a more clear focus and strong foundation I began rough sketching out screens from my user flows in low fidelity. I always start with sketches because it allows me to base design structure and allow for rapid iterations of
        wireframes.</p>
      <div class="wireframes">
        <div class="wireframe1">
          <img src="Images/case/wireframe1.svg" alt="wireframe" class="wireframe" />
        </div>
        <div class="wireframes2">
          <img src="Images/case/wireframe2.svg" alt="wireframe" class="wireframe" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>After making adjustments, I created the high fidelity digital wireframes and brought it to life. This digital version allowed me to test them and see if there was any confusion or complications with this design.</p>

    <!--Usability Testing-->
    <section id="usability1" class="sections">
      <img src="Images/case/testtab1.svg" alt="usability testing" class="tab" />
      <img src="Images/case/usabilitypic.svg" alt="3 screen mockup" class="sprinkle_wire" />
      <p>I used my high fidelity mockups to conduct a usability test. I created a clickable prototype in Invision and two users were tasked with completing the account creation process, adding a recipe and organizing uploaded files. The tasks were
        largely completed with few issues, however there were informative suggestions that popped up through testing. These suggestions resulted in a more efficient payment page during account creation and better clarification with buttons.</p>
      <button class="usebutton">
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pO3IoK-hcpzasKD6M-mViF6dUzanv3ODj54dHlnfnzg/edit?usp=sharing">
          <span class="button_words">View Analysis</span>
        </a>
      </button>
      <p>One of the participants noticed that the payment page did not include the expiration date.</p>
      <div class="paymentpages">
        <img class="paymentpage1" src="Images/case/paymentpage1.svg" alt="payment page" class="payment" />
        <img class="paymentpage2" src="Images/case/paymentpage2.svg" alt="payment page" class="payment" />
      </div>
      <p>This is the payment page after the change was made.</p>

    <!--Branding-->

      <img src="Images/case/brandtab.svg" alt="branding" class="tab" />
      <img src="Images/case/largelogo.svg" alt="sprinkle logo" class="sprinklelogo" />
      <p>I wanted Sprinkle to be fresh yet playful and colorful while being simple and clean so I used bright colors throughout the application and logo design. I used a riff of the primary color scheme, but instead used shades of magenta, turquoise
        and yellow.</p>
      <img src="Images/case/styleguide.svg" alt="style guide" class="styleguide" />
      <p>I used the same color choices of the logo throughout the design. Because Sprinkle is targeted toward home bakers of all types, I wanted the app to have a lot of color used strategically that conveyed the playfulness of the industry yet still
        sophisticated and functional for a business mangement app.</p>

      <div class="sidebar1">
        <p class="sidebardeets">The initial design of Sprinkle featured a dark magenta side bar menu. I tested users in order to see if dark magenta was preferred over another color, dark turquoise. For this portion, dark turquoise was preferred over
          dark magenta.</p>

        <p class="menudeets">I also tested the menu style to see which style wa preferred. According to the results the style choice with darker varations of grey was preferred more than the lighter version.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="infohigh">
        <p class="infodeets">I tested the highlight background on an information element on the app too see what was preferred. The choices were yellow and turquoise. Surprisingly enough the yellow background was preferred.</p>

      <p>After the transformation to high fidelity, now it was time for a second usability test. For this test I used both the desktop and mobile versions to ensure continuity between both versions. I recevied better feedback this time with one user

        <h3>What I learned...</h3>
        <p>From this project I learned the importance of research and testing. This project taught me to make sure I have strong research as a foundation and the importance of testing. It is really easy for a designer to make assumptions about what
          the users may want but those assumptions need to be tested and proven valid.</p>
        <h3>What I would change...</h3>
        <p>If time we’re free, next steps for this project would be adding some customization choices for the users as well as effective microinteractions and animation elements. I would have spent less time on early deliverables such as my initial
          digital wireframes and trying to make them perfect. I quickly learned that testing and iterations are key.</p>
        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>From ideation to completion, Sprinkle underwent many changes and iterations. This project started without a target audience, product name or even a specific problem in mind but ended with a solution. Taking a vague concept and creating a
          tangible website as a beginner was overwhelming but a great learning experience and tremendous for my career as a designer.</p>
