      <p> The two user personas on this project represented real-world users with varying degrees of frustrations and desires from data was collected from the user surveys and competitive analysis. Here we have Sarah and Madison both represent a large
        part of the target audience for this project. Sarah is a former stay at home mom who balances caring for her family and running a small baking business. She's busy and doesn't have a ton of time and looking to streamline and simplify her
        business.
        Next we have Madison who is a graphic artist by day and baking entrepreneur by night. She runs her baking business on the side while working full-time, so while she hasn't started her own family yet, she is just as busy and looking to
        simplify her business as well. Both users, albeit different circumstances are looking for a solution to the business challenges they face.</p>

      <p>Next I created user stories to start the process of visualizing what the users want to accomplish. These are the high priority stories listed above that were discovered to be important for a functional Minimum Value Product.
        These functions include adding and editing a recipe, scheduling orders, uploading files and other various functions.</p>

      <p class="flows1">From my user stories I was able to create user flows for each high priority task to demonstrate how users will navigate to complete various actions. First i sketched them out via pen and paper, then created flows digitally.
        These flows are critical to identifying key functions within the app and which screens to focus on first. Completing this set the foundations of the app design.</p>
      <div class="sitemaps">

          <p>I used my research data, user stories, and user flows to create a sitemap in order to organize each destination in the user flows. The sitemap was used as an outline to create the content strategy and help me further focus on keeping the
            project within scope and further helped solidify the foundation of the project.

      </div>
      <p>Now that I have a more clear focus and strong foundation I began rough sketching out screens from my user flows in low fidelity. I always start with sketches because it allows me to base design structure and allow for rapid iterations of
        wireframes.</p>

      <p>I used my high fidelity mockups to conduct a usability test. I created a clickable prototype in Invision and two users were tasked with completing the account creation process, adding a recipe and organizing uploaded files. The tasks were
        largely completed with few issues, however there were informative suggestions that popped up through testing. These suggestions resulted in a more efficient payment page during account creation and better clarification with buttons.</p>

      <p>I wanted Sprinkle to be fresh yet playful and colorful while being simple and clean so I used bright colors throughout the application and logo design. I used a riff of the primary color scheme, but instead used shades of magenta, turquoise
        and yellow.</p>
      <img src="Images/case/styleguide.svg" alt="style guide" class="styleguide" />
      <p>I used the same color choices of the logo throughout the design. Because Sprinkle is targeted toward home bakers of all types, I wanted the app to have a lot of color used strategically that conveyed the playfulness of the industry yet still
        sophisticated and functional for a business mangement app.</p>

      <p>After the transformation to high fidelity, now it was time for a second usability test. For this test I used both the desktop and mobile versions to ensure continuity between both versions. I recevied better feedback this time with one user
        who suggested a few changes to the illustrations featured on the sign up page.</p>

        <h3>What I learned...</h3>
        <p>From this project I learned the importance of research and testing. This project taught me to make sure I have strong research as a foundation and the importance of testing. It is really easy for a designer to make assumptions about what
          the users may want but those assumptions need to be tested and proven valid.</p>
        <h3>What I would change...</h3>
        <p>If time we’re free, next steps for this project would be adding some customization choices for the users as well as effective microinteractions and animation elements. I would have spent less time on early deliverables such as my initial
          digital wireframes and trying to make them perfect. I quickly learned that testing and iterations are key.</p>
        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>From ideation to completion, Sprinkle underwent many changes and iterations. This project started without a target audience, product name or even a specific problem in mind but ended with a solution. Taking a vague concept and creating a
          tangible website as a beginner was overwhelming but a great learning experience and tremendous for my career as a designer.</p>
