      <h2>The scoop about me...</h2>
      <p>Cake was the reason why I got back into design. I know it sounds strange but hear me out. I haven’t had the most traditional path into UX design. I started by taking some design and art classes in college (shout out to professor Glabicki)
        and even aspired to becoming a graphic designer but somehow I detoured into risk management after college, segwayed into finance and taking a detour into a running cake decorating business on the side. Each job I had I never felt like I
        belonged but I couldn't put my finger on why.</p>
      <p> It wasn’t until I spent two weeks choosing the right cupcake packaging for an upcoming holiday order when I realized I was more interested in the design aspect of cakes than baking them. I remembered how happy I was back in college while
        taking art and design classes and the passion I once had when striving for getting into design as a career. That’s when I knew what I was missing, the reason why I always felt out of place at work.</p>
      <p>Countless youtube videos and blogs lead me to develop a thirst for learning more about design. I started to go to message designers on linkedin and go to local design events in Pittsburgh where I connected with designers who not only
        encouraged and inspired me but gave me invaluable advice. I felt like I belonged in this field and needed to pursue it. I took a leap of faith and enrolled in a design mentorship program called Bloc. I could not have made a better decision
        for myself. Through the program and with the help and guidance of my mentors, Aaron Uyehara and Jennifer Trich Kremer I learned how to channel my skills in previous non-design jobs and newly acquired education to create user centered
        products. UX design encompasses all of my passions in one - and when I am passionate about something it becomes a part of me.</p>

    <p>Besides design, I have a love for God, traveling, cooking and baking. In my spare time I mentor teenagers at my local church on navigating life and tapping into their creativity.</p>
